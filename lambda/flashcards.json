        "answer": "`re.finditer()` returns an iterator yielding match objects, while `re.findall()` returns a list of strings. Use `finditer` when you want to access group information, `findall` when you only need the matching strings."

          "answer": "`item.groupdict()` is used to return a dictionary containing all the named subgroups of the match. But in this case, it's incorrect because `re.findall()` doesn't return match objects."
